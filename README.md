# ken-ken Puzzle Solver\
This is a Python-based KenKen Puzzle Solver with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It allows users to define custom KenKen puzzles and solve them using either a backtracking algorithm or a genetic algorithm. You can observe each algorithm step-by-step or solve the puzzle instantly.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Support for customizable grid sizes (from 2x2 to 12x12).

âž• Add your own cages with arithmetic constraints.

ðŸ§  Two solving methods:

Backtracking (exact and guaranteed to find a solution)

Genetic Algorithm (evolutionary approach, may find near-optimal solutions)

ðŸ‘€ Visualization mode to observe how each algorithm works in real time.

ðŸ§¹ Easy controls to clear grid and logs.
